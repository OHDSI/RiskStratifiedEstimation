\usage{
createStudyPopulationCmArgs(population = NULL,
  firstExposureOnly = FALSE, restrictToCommonPeriod = FALSE,
  washoutPeriod = 0, removeDuplicateSubjects = FALSE,
  removeSubjectsWithPriorOutcome = TRUE, priorOutcomeLookback = 99999,

}
\arguments{
\item{population}{If specified, this population will be used as the startingpoint
instead of the cohorts in the cohortMethodDataobject.}

\item{firstExposureOnly}{Should only the first exposure per subject be included? Note that
this is typically done in thecreateStudyPopulation function,}

\item{restrictToCommonPeriod}{Restrict the analysis to the period when both exposures are
observed?}

\item{washoutPeriod}{The mininum required continuous observation time prior to
index date for a person to be included in the cohort.}

\item{removeDuplicateSubjects}{Remove subjects that are in both the target and comparator cohort?
See details for allowed values.}

\item{removeSubjectsWithPriorOutcome}{Remove subjects that have the outcome prior to the risk window
start?}

\item{priorOutcomeLookback}{How many days should we look back when identifying prioroutcomes?}

\item{minDaysAtRisk}{The minimum required number of days at risk.}

\item{riskWindowStart}{The start of the risk window (in days) relative to the indexdate
(+ days of exposure if theaddExposureDaysToStart parameter is
specified).}

\item{addExposureDaysToStart}{Add the length of exposure the start of the risk window?}

\item{riskWindowEnd}{The end of the risk window (in days) relative to the index data
(+ days of exposure if the addExposureDaysToEndparameter is
specified).}

\item{addExposureDaysToEnd}{Add the length of exposure the risk window?}

\item{censorAtNewRiskWindow}{If a subject is in multiple cohorts, should time-at-risk be
censored when the new time-at-risk starts to prevent overlap?}
