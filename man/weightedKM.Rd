\usage{
weightedKM(ps, calculateWeights = TRUE, weightsType = "ATE",
  useStabilizedWeights = TRUE, extremeWeights, truncationLevels,
  cvLikeRepetitions, stepTruncationLevels)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{A data frame including the propensity scores as generated from \code{\link[CohortMethod]{createPs}}}

\item{calculateWeights}{Whether to calculate the weights using \code{\link[RiskStratifiedEstimation]{createIPW}}}

\item{weightsType}{The type of the weights to be used. Allowed options are 'ATE' for average treatment effect and 'ATT' for average treatment effect on the treated weights}

\item{useStabilizedWeights}{Should stabilized weights be used?}

\item{extremeWeights}{The way to assess extreme weights. Possible options are 'unadjusted, 'cvLikeTruncation', 'crumpTrimming', 'fixedTruncaiton'}

\item{truncationLevels}{The level of truncation expressed in percentiles of the propensity score. If extremeWeights is 'fixedTruncation' then the weights will be truncated at the levels defined here. If extremeWeights is 'cvLikeTruncation' then the data adaptive procedure will only assess truncation up to the levels defined here}

\item{cvLikeRepetitions}{The number of times to repeat the 2-fold cross-validations}

\item{stepTruncationLevels}{The steps for the grid of possible truncation levels}
}
\value{
A data frame with the Kaplan-Meier estimates
}
\description{
Calculates the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates based on: Xie J, Liu C. Adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimator and log-rank test with inverse probability of treatment weighting for survival data. Statistics in Medicine 2005; 2:3089â€“3110.
