\title{Calculates the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates}
\usage{
weightedKM(ps, calculateWeights = TRUE, weightsType = "ATE",
  useStabilizedWeights = TRUE, truncationLevels)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{A data frame including the propensity scores as generated from
\code{\link[CohortMethod]{createPs}}}

\item{calculateWeights}{Whether to calculate the weights using
\code{\link[RiskStratifiedEstimation]{createIPW}}}

\item{weightsType}{The type of the weights to be used. Allowed options are 'ATE' for average treatment
effect and 'ATT' for average treatment effect on the treated weights}

\item{useStabilizedWeights}{Should stabilized weights be used?}

\item{truncationLevels}{The level of truncation expressed in percentiles of the propensity score.}
