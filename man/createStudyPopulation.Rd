  firstExposureOnly = FALSE, restrictToCommonPeriod = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{cohortMethodData}{An object of type \code{cohortMethodData} as generated using
\code{getDbCohortMethodData}.}

\item{population}{If specified, this population will be used as the starting
point instead of the cohorts in the \code{cohortMethodData}
object.}

\item{outcomeId}{The ID of the outcome. If not specified, no outcome-specific
transformations will be performed.}

\item{firstExposureOnly}{Should only the first exposure per subject be included? Note
that this is typically done in the
\code{createStudyPopulation} function,}

\item{restrictToCommonPeriod}{Restrict the analysis to the period when both treatments are observed?}

\item{washoutPeriod}{The mininum required continuous observation time prior to
index date for a person to be included in the cohort.}

\item{removeDuplicateSubjects}{Remove subjects that are in both the treated and comparator
cohort? See details for allowed values.}

\item{removeSubjectsWithPriorOutcome}{Remove subjects that have the outcome prior to the risk
window start?}

\item{priorOutcomeLookback}{How many days should we look back when identifying prior
outcomes?}

\item{minDaysAtRisk}{The minimum required number of days at risk.}

\item{riskWindowStart}{The start of the risk window (in days) relative to the index
date (+ days of exposure if the
\code{addExposureDaysToStart} parameter is specified).}

\item{addExposureDaysToStart}{Add the length of exposure the start of the risk window?}

\item{riskWindowEnd}{The end of the risk window (in days) relative to the index
data (+ days of exposure if the \code{addExposureDaysToEnd}
parameter is specified).}

\item{addExposureDaysToEnd}{Add the length of exposure the risk window?}

\item{censorAtNewRiskWindow}{If a subject is in multiple cohorts, should time-at-risk be censored
when the new time-at-risk starts to prevent overlap?}
}
\value{
A data frame specifying the study population. This data frame will have the following columns:
\describe{ \item{rowId}{A unique identifier for an exposure} \item{subjectId}{The person ID of the
subject} \item{cohortStartdate}{The index date} \item{outcomeCount}{The number of outcomes observed
during the risk window} \item{timeAtRisk}{The number of days in the risk window}
\item{survivalTime}{The number of days until either the outcome or the end of the risk window} }
}
\description{
Create a study population
}
\details{
Create a study population by enforcing certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, defining a risk
window, and determining which outcomes fall inside the risk window.

The \code{removeduplicateSubjects} argument can have one of the following values:
\describe{
  \item{"keep all"}{Do not remove subjects that appear in both target and comparator cohort}
  \item{"keep first"}{When a subjects appear in both target and comparator cohort, only keep whichever cohort is first in time.}
  \item{"remove all"}{Remove subjects that appear in both target and comparator cohort completely from the analysis."}
}
}
